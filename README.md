# TV-show-finder
This is a small project to go back and practice skills, using axios to get data from TVmaze api about tv shows online and displaying them onscreen with the shows poster image, title and ratings. If a show doesnt have any data for its images then an image of a cute frog will be displayed instead

## Technologies
-HTML -SASS -JS -Materialize

### About
This was a fairly straight forward project using axios to retreive data from an api using AJAX. If any show searched with the correct search term doesnt have an image a frog will be shown instead... Implementing this tiny feature was the brain twister of this project, but a simple logic gate solved my issues.
